# JavaScript Array Operations & Exercises

## Overview
This repository contains JavaScript code demonstrating various array operations and exercises. The script includes:
- Iterating through arrays using loops
- Finding the largest element in an array
- Working with nested arrays
- Solving common array-related problems
- Implementing basic stack operations using push and pop

## File Description
The provided JavaScript file includes:
1. **For Loop Method**: Iterating through an array using a `for` loop.
2. **ForEach Loop Method**: Iterating through an array using `forEach`.
3. **Finding the Largest Element**: Identifies the largest number in an array.
4. **Nested Array Traversal**: Prints elements of a nested array.
5. **Exercise 01**: Finds all pairs that sum up to a given target.
6. **Exercise 02**: Identifies common elements between two arrays.
7. **Exercise 03**: Finds the most frequently occurring element in an array.
8. **Array Operations (Push & Pop)**: Demonstrates basic stack operations.
9. **Exercise 04**: Reverses an array using push & pop.
