# Student Management API ðŸ“š

Welcome to the **Student Management API** built using **Node.js** and **Express**! This simple API helps manage student data, allowing you to fetch lists of students or individual student details using their registration number. It's designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and highly extensible.
