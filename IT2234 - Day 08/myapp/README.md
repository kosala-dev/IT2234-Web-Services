# Student Management API 

Welcome to the **Student Management API** built using **Node.js** and **Express**! This simple API helps manage student data, allowing you to fetch lists of students or individual student details using their registration number. It's designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and highly extensible.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

StudentData.js // Contains a sample list of students

StudentService.js // Provides services to fetch student data

StudentRoute.js // API routes for handling requests

index.js // Sets up the server and connects routes
